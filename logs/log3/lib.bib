	abstract = {Main responsibility of a transport protocol is to support communication between two end-to-end entities. These entities can be hosts or devices, such as routers, firewalls etc. Transport protocol provides mechanism to have a virtually circuited route between these two end-to-end devices. Transport protocol are of two types: Connection oriented and connection-less. As these name suggest, connection oriented requires additional work of setting up connections and provide reliability in terms of packet reordering, congestion control, reliable delivery of packets. On the other hand connectionless transport protocol adapts, sends and forgets mechanism. Its entire purpose is to deliver the datagram without having to worry about its delivery. There are two major protocols, {TCP} and {UDP}, used for connection oriented and connection-less services respectively. Being a connection oriented protocol, {TCP} provides a reliable end-to-end connection and have congestion control mechanisms to avoid buffer overflow at the receiver side.},

@article{alawaji_ietf_nodate,
	title = {{IETF} {QUIC} v1 Design},
	abstract = {{QUIC} is a transport layer protocol developed on top of {UDP} (User Datagram Protocol) to overcome the inherited issues with {TCP} (Transmission Control Protocol), such as Head of Line blocking and connection establishment. The primary purpose of {QUIC} is to reduce connection latency. This paper discusses {QUIC} packet format, {QUIC} headers, how {QUIC} establishes a connection, how {QUIC} overcomes {TCP} issues, and the congestion control methods used by {QUIC}.},
